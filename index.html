            Hello, I'm Yinuo Liu (also call me Nicole). I am an undergraduate student majoring in psychology (cognitive neuroscience trakc) and minoring in English translation and interpretation at the Zhejiang University, China (ranks 42nd in QS ranking). I'm expected to graduate in June, 2023.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm interested in the cognitive and neural mechanism underlying human language processing. I want to combine computational models and neural signals to understand it. I'm now applying for some Ph.D programs.
            <br>
            <br>
            I worked as a supervised researcher both in Cognomics Lab (PI: Prof. Xiangzhen Kong, one of the collaborators of Prof. Ev Fedorenko) and Attention and Memory Lab (PI: Prof. Ying Cai).
            In the Cognomics Lab, I conducted independent research in the language brain networks. I have a poster presentation about it at the OHBM 2022 Annual Meeting.
            In the Attention and Memory Lab, my work focuses on the feature binding in working memory. One of my works has been accepted by the 15th Annual Meeting of Chinese Neuroscience Society.
            Currenly, I'm a part-time research assistant in Language Brains and Machines Lab, working with Prof. Jixing Li.
            Welcome to check the details of them and my other programs in the research page.
            <br>
