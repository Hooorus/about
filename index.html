            <h4><strong>Freshman</strong></h4>
            <h5>Activity</h5>
            In the freshman stage, the main tasks were the daily <i>ACM</i> programming training and programming competitions.
            Because I participated in the school ACM team, the daily competitions followed the guidance of the coach <strong style="color: #f6b130">(Associate Professor: Jie Luo)</strong>
            and the arrangement of the seniors. I have participated in about a dozen online and offline programming competitions of
            various sizes, including programming competitions held by various universities, <i>Zhejiang Provincial Team Programming Ladder
            Competition</i>, and <i>Zhejiang Province Tusson Future Cup programming competition</i>, etc.
            <h5>Experience</h5>
            At this stage, I have overcome many algorithmic problems and mastered the flexible use of many algorithmic knowledge and
            skills. I used my existing knowledge to solve the <i>Data Structure</i> problem, submitted and passed
            (Accept, abbreviation: AC) the code test (Debug). This stage helped me develop from a person who was afraid of this
            field at the beginning to a person who understands data structure and algorithm problems and can solve some difficulties
            independently. I have mastered a lot of data structure and algorithm knowledge, such as: <i>data structure basics</i>, <i>graph
            theory</i>, <i>dynamic programming (DP)</i>, etc., and can use C++ language and its internal <i>STL functions</i> more proficiently, and
            abstract some common problems into some common problems. algorithm problem. This lays the foundation for solving some
            more complex and difficult problems in the future.

            <h4><strong>Sophomore</strong></h4>
            <h5>Activity</h5>
            In the sophomore stage, I was mainly engaged in the work of <i>Design and Development of Web Applications</i>, supplemented by
            <i>Technical Architecture Design</i> in the <i>Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition</i>. When I was first exposed to
            knowledge related to web application design and development in the classroom, I became very interested in it.
            Therefore, in the following time, I invested a lot of time and energy, researched, studied and made many small projects.
            As my technical skills gradually improved, I also participated in many competitions related to this to prove my ability.
            At the same time, I also applied this kind of knowledge to innovation and entrepreneurship projects, providing reasonable
            technical ideas and product architecture design for the innovation and entrepreneurship team.
            <h5>Experience</h5>
            At this stage, I learned and mastered a lot of knowledge about <i>Web development</i> (Html, Css, JavaScript front-end,
            Java back-end, MySql database) by participating in development-related competitions and developing small websites
            and systems by myself, and mastered many popular <i>Web development technology frameworks</i> (such as Vue.js and SpringBoot).
            And practiced software and application design patterns and development processes for the first time in the team. In addition,
            the <i>Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition</i> also helped me cultivate innovative thinking and improve my ability to
            cooperate with a team.

            <h4><strong>Junior</strong></h4>
            <h5>Activity</h5>
            In the junior year, my work focused on learning in the field of <i>Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence</i> and <i>improvement
            of academic ability</i>, supplemented by <i>software design and development</i> and <i>Internet + China University Student Innovation
            and Entrepreneurship Competition</i>. I participated in the <i>Huawei Cloud HCCDA-AI training</i>, the <i>Machine Learning and Data Mining
            scientific research project</i> of <i>Path Academic College</i>, and published an overseas conference paper. As the technical support of the
            innovation and entrepreneurship team, I continue to assist the team to improve the technology of innovation and
            entrepreneurship projects At the same time, my ability has been appreciated by many school leaders, who gave me some task
            requirements, such as: I hope to develop the voting system of the innovation and entrepreneurship college used within the
            school, and the development of the management system of the Chinese pharmacy. Live up to expectations, I In a short period
            of time, the <i>voting system of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Academy</i> and the management system of <i>TCMA Chinese pharmacy</i>
            were developed, and the project was delivered to the leaders for acceptance and display, which received their unanimous
            praise (there are screenshots to prove it). At the same time, I also once again cooperated with a powerful The technical
            team developed the <i>Aojie teaching management platform</i> together and applied for the software copyright.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Experience</h5>
            At this stage, through <strong>1.</strong> Participating in various artificial intelligence projects and training, I have mastered classic
            algorithm models and artificial intelligence models currently popular in various fields. <strong>2.</strong> Participate in development-related
            competitions and help lead the development of the system to further improve the understanding and familiarity of application
            development and the ability of teamwork development. <strong>3.</strong> Participated in the <i>Internet + Chinese University Student Innovation
            and Entrepreneurship Competition</i>, and participated in the design and invention of a diagnosis and treatment instrument that can
            help diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly in advance.
